# Hi! 👋 I'm Michael

<img src="https://mrhanna.dev/images/logo.svg" align="right" alt="Michael Hanna logo" width="200">

🎷 I'm a freelance musician and educator actively pivoting into software development, bringing the same discipline, creativity, and problem-solving mindset that shaped my success in performance and teaching.

💻 I'm a self-taught developer with a strong focus on **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **React**, and **modern full-stack architecture**. My background includes building solo projects that integrate custom APIs, CMS platforms like **Strapi**, and mobile-first UIs with **Next.js**, **Expo**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

🚀 I'm currently seeking a **junior developer role** where I can grow as part of a collaborative team, continue building great products, and learn from experienced engineers.

📫 Feel free to explore my repos or reach out at **hanna.michaelr@gmail.com**.

## Portfolio

### 🧩 2048 — A React+TypeScript Rebuild

A responsive, accessible, and animation-rich remake of the classic 2048 puzzle game.  
Built with React + TypeScript + Vite, with custom game logic, reducer-based state, smooth CSS-in-JS transitions, and persistent scores across configurable grid sizes.

🔨 Projects I've worked on:
- **Uptown Alive** – a content-rich local business directory powered by Strapi and Next.js
- **HIIT the Deck** – a React Native fitness app that gamifies workouts with animated card draws

I may resurrect these projects and add them to the portfolio soon...
