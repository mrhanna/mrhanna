# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Michael Hanna

ðŸŽ· I'm a freelance musician and educator actively pivoting into software development â€” bringing the same discipline, creativity, and problem-solving mindset that shaped my success in performance and teaching.

ðŸ’» I'm a self-taught web developer with a strong focus on **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **React**, and **modern full-stack architecture**. My background includes building solo projects that integrate custom APIs, CMS platforms like **Strapi**, and mobile-first UIs with **Next.js**, **Expo**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

ðŸ”¨ Projects I've worked on:
- **Uptown Alive** â€“ a content-rich local business directory powered by Strapi and Next.js
- **HIIT the Deck** â€“ a React Native fitness app that gamifies workouts with animated card draws

ðŸš€ I'm currently seeking a **junior developer role** where I can grow as part of a collaborative team, continue building great products, and learn from experienced engineers.

ðŸ“« Feel free to explore my repos or reach out at **hanna.michaelr@gmail.com**.
